This is my submission for the Streamforge code challenge.

## Setup/Usage
1. Clone this repository.
1. In the root directory, use `npm install` to install the dependencies for the backend server and `npm run client-install` to install the dependencies for the client app.
1. Start both the backend and the client app servers using `npm run dev`. If you want to start them individually, use `npm run server` for the backend and `npm run client` for the client app. 
1. The client will be served at `http://localhost:8080/` and the backend at `http://localhost:3000/`.
